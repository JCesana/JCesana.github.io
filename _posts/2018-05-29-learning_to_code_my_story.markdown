I had to make a decision: accounting or computer science?

It was 2001. I had the opportunity and great pleasure of attending [Biola University](http://www.biola.edu). I had to decide on a major. Should I choose accounting or computer science? Both are great degrees that can provide a world of opportunity upon graduation.

Both fields are analytical, logical, and generally, require a methodical temperament. I had the patience, drive, and determination to succeed in either field. Which one should I pick?

I chose accounting. I mean, what successful business doesn't need accountants, right? I would have no trouble finding a job for the rest of my life.

But one question I didn't give much attention was, "do I enjoy it?" Upon graduating, I worked for a wonderful medium sized CPA firm located in the heart of Orange County. I joined their team and was immediately gaining experience evaluating financial statements and performing company audits.

I wanted to like it. I really, really wanted to like it. This job has amazing potential and can lead to great opportunities and help me meet wonderful people.

But I simply couldn't do it. I did not enjoy the work. I thought to myself, what else do I enjoy?

Then I thought of when I was 15 years old when my older brother gave me my own "website" for my birthday. He had space on a server and gave me free reign on a webpage to do with it whatever I want.

For fun, I decided to create a webpage that was a collection of goofy and fun .WAV files for people to download. This was in Yahoo's heyday, so I immediately listed my new creating in their search directory. To make a long story short, the website gained so much traction that my brother had to shut it down because of all the attention and traffic it was getting.

Building something from scratch that was useful to people was a strangely rewarding feeling. That feeling was absent in my accounting work, which is perhaps why I was immediately turned off to it after diving in.

Fast forward to right now in 2018, I have decided that I want to pursue development as a full-time career.

In my eyes, coding has a lot to offer.

It can be a rewarding and fulfilling career that can be used to help many, many people.

Coding can lead you to wonderful places, meaning that with hard work and determination, you can work for some of the best companies in the world, with the smartest, most genuine people.

While the list of benefits is endless, coding can overall be a gateway to an improved life. It can provide you with endless opportunities, personal and intellectual growth, and a rewarding and fulling career.

This is why I want to learn coding, and why I am currently pursuing it as a full-time career. I am currently a full time student at [Flatiron](https://flatironschool.com/)'s online web development program. My goal is to soon have a full time career in web development, and more importantly, have a fulfilling and rewarding career that helps people.

More to come. Thanks for reading.
