# My Sinatra MVC CRUD Assessment Project

I've come a long way from trying free coding exercises online. Remember those? Reverse this string... join this array.... While those were undoubtedly fun and engaging, I'm not proudly making full blown web applications! I honestly can't really believe it.

I actually made a website with users, encrypted passwords, a database, the ability for users to create, edit, and delete content... it's actually quite amazing!

For those who are confused by the acronyms in the title...

CRUD stands for:

**C**reate  
**R**ead  
**U**pdate  
**D**elete  

## MVC Stands for...

**M**odel  
**V**iew  
**C**ontroller  

My web application, found [here](https://github.com/JCesana/sinatra-final-project-tasks) for the curious, was built with the **MVC** structure in mind.

## What is MVC?

To summarize how MVC works (real world example coming later), **Models** are basically what structure your data. It's the brains of the operation. If you were to change the logic in your web application, you would change a Model responsible for that logic.

**Views** are responsible for showing the data to the user. This can be an HTML page with forms or tables, for example. Getting the data and presenting the data to the user is the responsibility of a view (often multiple views).

Lastly, **Controllers** are responsible for sending and receiving instructions, perhaps to and from the user to the Models. Basically, it *controls* the app.

Not to put this in a real world example that non-coders can relate to (found in [this](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/model-view-controller-mvc-explained-through-ordering-drinks-at-the-bar-efcba6255053) interesting article), think of going to a bar.

You've been to a bar, right?

Of course you have.

## Bar Example

Let's say you head in to the bar on a typical Saturday night and order a drink. It's ridiculously crowded, but you shove your way forward. You ask the bartender for a martini. In this case, you are the **user**, and your drink order was the **user request** (think of a user using Facebook, and sending a "user request" to refresh their feed).

The bartender gets to work and starts making your concoction. The various tools that he has at his disposal, the glass, the alcohol, the olive juice, etc, are the the **Models.**  They are the backbone and very substance of what is happening here.

Lastly, when he delivers your drink to you and it sits on the bar in front of you, it represents the **view.** You see the final product - the final objective of entire process.

See? Learning about coding can be fun!

My project was extremely fun to create, and very satisfying to complete. I can only think of how it feels to create even larger, more intricate projects that have real world implications.

One day, I will find out!
